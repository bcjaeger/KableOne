Description: In many academic papers, table 1 shows participant
    characteristics, often stratified by a categorical variable
    such as treatment group. There are many excellent packages
    available to compute the numbers in table 1. This package
    focuses on getting those numbers into a nice format that 
    works with Rmarkdown.
